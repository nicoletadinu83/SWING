12.1(Using the FlowLayout manager) Write a program that meets the following
requirements (see Figure 12.14):
■ Create a frame and set its layout to FlowLayout.
■ Create two panels and add them to the frame.
■ Each panel contains three buttons. The panel uses FlowLayout.
********************************************
12.2 (Using the BorderLayout manager) Rewrite the preceding program to create
the same user interface, but instead of using FlowLayout for the frame, use
BorderLayout. Place one panel in the south of the frame and the other in the
center.
***************************************************
12.3 (Using the GridLayout manager) Rewrite the preceding program to create the
same user interface. Instead of using FlowLayout for the panels, use a
GridLayout of two rows and three columns.
**********************************************************
12.4 (Using JPanel to group buttons) Rewrite the preceding program to create the
same user interface. Instead of creating buttons and panels separately, define a
class that extends the JPanel class. Place three buttons in your panel class, and
create two panels from the user-defined panel class.
*****************************************************************************
12.5 (Displaying labels) Write a program that displays four lines of text in four
labels, as shown in Figure 12.15(a). Add a line border on each label.
******************************************************
12.6 (Displaying icons) Write a program that displays four icons in four labels, as
shown in Figure 12.15(b). Add a line border on each label. (Use any images of
your choice or those in the book, which can be obtained along with the book’s
source code.)
*************************

12.8* (Swing common features) Display a frame that contains six labels. Set the background
of the labels to white. Set the foreground of the labels to black, blue,
cyan, green, magenta, and orange, respectively, as shown in Figure 12.16(a). Set
the border of each label to a line border with the yellow color. Set the font of
each label to TimesRoman, bold, and 20 pixels. Set the text and tool tip text of
each label to the name of its foreground color.
FIGURE 12.14 Exercise 12.1 places the first three buttons in one panel and the other three
buttons in another panel.
***********************************************************
12.9* (Game: displaying three cards) Display a frame that contains three labels. Each
label displays a card, as shown in Figure 12.16(b). The card image files are named
1.png, 2.png, 54.png and stored in the image/card directory. All three cards
are distinct and selected randomly. The image files can be obtained from
www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro8e/book.zip.
***************************************************
12.10* (Game: displaying a checkerboard) Write a program that displays a checkerboard
in which each white and black cell is a JButton with a background black
or white, as shown in Figure 12.16(c).
